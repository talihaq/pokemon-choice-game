                Welcome to the Pokémon Lab, Trainer. I'm Professor Oak.<br/>
                Unfortunately, you were a little too slow signing in.<br/>
                I don't have anymore starter Pokémon left...
            </p>
            <p> 
                You could come back again next year (and maybe sign in more quickly).<br/>
                Or... Well, I have this Pikachu...<br/> 
                But he's not exactly suitable for a complete beginner...

                Do you have what it takes to be Pikachu's trainer?<br/>
